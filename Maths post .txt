My first expression is: 4+5(67*7-6*9/5)

First, we simplify the innermost operations within parentheses:

67 * 7 = 469 6 * 9 = 54 54 / 5 = 10.8

Now, we substitute these values back into the original expression:

4 + 5 * (469 - 10.8)

Next, we perform the subtraction within the parentheses:

469 - 10.8 = 458.2

Finally, we evaluate the multiplication outside the parentheses:

5 * 458.2 = 2291

Now, we add the remaining number:

4 + 2291 = 2295

Therefore, the result of the expression "4 + 5(677-69/5)" is 2295.
